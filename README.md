# Pizza Express OS – Everything OpenCentauri Does… Plus Blackjack & Hookers 🍕🃏💃

## Why This Exists

OpenCentauri (OC) is solid: bug fixes, remote access, stability, and quality-of-life improvements for the Elegoo Centauri Carbon.  

**Pizza Express OS** takes all of that **and cranks it to 11**. Every OC feature, every fix, every QoL tweak is here—plus blackjack, hookers, chaos, and the occasional slice of pepperoni.  

In short:  
- **OC** = “Let’s make firmware stable and responsible.”  
- **Pizza Express OS** = “Everything OC does… but cooler, funnier, and slightly dangerous.”

## Background

This repo is a fork of work originally started by **ultimateshadsform** on the AnyCubic Kobra Firmware tools, passed down through **PDSComp**, **Sims**, and a few others. Big shoutout to them for building the foundation… but let’s be honest, they were just trying to fix bugs.  

I forked it because I wanted blackjack, hookers, chaos, and maybe a slice of pepperoni.  

Scripts have been modified, rewritten, tweaked, or sacrificed to support Carbon-specific firmware tasks. If a script isn’t specifically called out here, consider it a gamble: it might work, it might brick your printer, it might order you a pizza.  

If there are two versions of a script, the one with `-ac` in the name is the oldest AnyCubic version—kept for nostalgia, regret, or pure schadenfreude.
